## Who We Are
The [Palisadoes Foundation](https://www.palisadoes.org) sponsors open-source software projects to help community groups organize their daily activities and more. A significant proportion of our software contributions come from university students studying software engineering. Participants often come from under-served communities or geographic areas and are sponsored through the various programs in which we participate. This prepares them for the competitive realities of the working world.
