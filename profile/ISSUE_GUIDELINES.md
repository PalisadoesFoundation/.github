## Common Issue Searches

Each of our online GitHub repositories has a tab labeled `issues` which describe the bugs and features we are working on.

1. Each repository has issues labeled `good first issues`, try tackling these first. They contain challenges with a limited scope for beginners.
   1. Add this text to the GitHub issue search bar: `is:issue state:open label:"good first issue"`
3. There are issues labeled `test` for creating tests for our code base. We need to increase reliablility. Try those issues, or create your own for files that don't already have tests. This is another good strategy for beginners.
   1. Add this text to the GitHub issue search bar `is:issue state:open label:test`
4. There are dormant issues labeled `no-issue-activity`. These are issues on which nobody has worked for some time and are another place to start.
   1. Add this text to the GitHub issue search bar `is:issue state:open label:no-issue-activity`
5. You can find unassigned issues by adding this text to the GitHub issue search bar `is:issue state:open no:assignee`

## Creating New Issues

**Note:** You don't have to ask for permission to create issues.

To create new issues follow these steps:

1. Your issue may have already been created. Search for duplicate open issues before submitting yours.for similar deficiencies in the code.duplicate issues are created. 
1. Verify whether the issue has been fixed by trying to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.
2. On the issues page, click on the [`New Issue`] button.
3. Use the templates to create a standardized report of what needs to be done and why.
4. If you want to be assigned the issue that you have created, then add the text `/assign` in a comment immediately after submitting the issue.

We welcome contributors who find new ways to make the code better.

## Existing Issues

You can also be a valuable contributor by searching for dormant issues. Here's how you can do that:

1. **Previously Assigned Issues**: We regularly review issues and add a [`no-issue-activity`](https://github.com/PalisadoesFoundation/talawa-admin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ano-issue-activity) label to them. Use the issue comments to ask whether the assignee is still working on the issue, and if not, ask for the issue to be assigned to you.
2. **Unassigned Issues**: If the issue is already reported and not assigned to anyone and you are interested in working on the issue then:
   1. Then add the text `/assign` in a comment immediately after submitting the issue.

Working on these types of existing issues is a good way of getting started with the community.

## Feature Request Issues

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the mentors of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## General Guidelines

1. Discuss issues in our various slack channels when necessary
2. Please do not derail or troll issues. 
3. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.
